Much of the information on an order from a customer is important! We’ve heard you’d like to copy and paste some of those details outside the app. Now you can long-press on most fields to copy them to the clipboard. Paste away in a text message, e-mail, or note!

We’ve also addressed several bugs around in-person payments and order creation. Thank you for your feedback!
